What's new?

4.6.6 contains a potpurri of new features...

I am considering changing the default behavior of ncks printing.
For 20+ years ncks has, by default, dumped the text representation
of a file in (what we call) "traditional" mode. CDL has become
increasingly popular, and may be more useful than traditional mode
for the majority of users. ncks has printed CDL only since 2013 and so
is not the default. ncdump has always printed CDL very cleanly and
clearly there was little point in making CDL the default for ncks.

ncks CDL mode has now matured to the point where it rivals ncdump, and
is arguably superior in many ways. I find myself using CDL more and
more and ncdump less and less. Hence I'm interested in changing
the default printed output of ncks to CDL, and requiring a new "--trd"
option to view the tradiational output. Then I can type simply
"ncks" instead of "ncks --cdl". 

Work on NCO 4.6.7 has commenced. Planned improvements include 
support for conda installs on MS Windows, and human-legible calendar
date printing, more ncclimo and ncremap features.

Enjoy,
Charlie

NEW FEATURES (full details always in ChangeLog):

A. ncks now prints the units, if any, in comments after CDL values
   when debugging is enabled with dbg_lvl >=1:
   zender@foo: ncks --cdl -D 1 in.nc
   lat = -90, 90 ; // units="degrees_north"
   lon = 0, 90, 180, 270 ; // units="degrees_east"
   tpt = 273.1, 273.2, ... 274 ; // units="kelvin"
   http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#cdl

A. fxm: not done yet
   Since 4.6.5 ncks has printed the human-legible calendar string
   corresponding to values with UDUnits date units (time since
   basetime, e.g., "days since 2000-01-01") and CF calendar attribute,
   if any. Now ncks also translates and prints time values associated
   with CF climatology and bounds variables as human legible dates.
   As before, enact this with the --calendar option when printing.
   Using dbg_lvl >= 1 in CDL mode prints both the value and calendar
   string (one in comments): 

   zender@aerosol:~$ ncks -D 1 --cdl --cal -v tm_365 ~/nco/data/in.nc
   tm_365 = "2013-03-01"; // double value: 59
   zender@aerosol:~$ ncks -D 1 --cdl -v tm_365 ~/nco/data/in.nc
   tm_365 = 59; // calendar format: "2013-03-01"

   This option is similar to the ncdump -t option.
   Does this work how you'd like? Let us know.

BUG FIXES:

A. ncks now prints the braces required to disambiguate compound
   record dimensions in CDL mode. Such braces have been required by 
   ncgen-like parsers since ~2013 in order to unambiguously determine
   the record dimension sizes in variables with multiple record
   dimensions. This fix only affects CDL printing of netCDF4 files
   that contain compound record variables. 

KNOWN PROBLEMS DUE TO NCO:

   This section of ANNOUNCE reports and reminds users of the
   existence and severity of known, not yet fixed, problems. 
   These problems occur with NCO 4.6.6 built/tested under
   MacOS 10.12.3 with netCDF 4.4.1 on HDF5 1.8.16 and with
   Linux with netCDF 4.4.2-development (20161116) on HDF5 1.8.16.

A. NOT YET FIXED (NCO problem)
   Correctly read arrays of NC_STRING with embedded delimiters in ncatted arguments

   Demonstration:
   ncatted -D 5 -O -a new_string_att,att_var,c,sng,"list","of","str,ings" ~/nco/data/in_4.nc ~/foo.nc
   ncks -m -C -v att_var ~/foo.nc

   20130724: Verified problem still exists
   TODO nco1102
   Cause: NCO parsing of ncatted arguments is not sophisticated
   enough to handle arrays of NC_STRINGS with embedded delimiters.

B. NOT YET FIXED (NCO problem?)
   ncra/ncrcat (not ncks) hyperslabbing can fail on variables with multiple record dimensions

   Demonstration:
   ncrcat -O -d time,0 ~/nco/data/mrd.nc ~/foo.nc

   20140826: Verified problem still exists
   20140619: Problem reported by rmla
   Cause: Unsure. Maybe ncra.c loop structure not amenable to MRD?
   Workaround: Convert to fixed dimensions then hyperslab

KNOWN PROBLEMS DUE TO BASE LIBRARIES/PROTOCOLS:

A. NOT YET FIXED (netCDF4 or HDF5 problem?)
   Specifying strided hyperslab on large netCDF4 datasets leads
   to slowdown or failure with recent netCDF versions.

   Demonstration with NCO <= 4.4.5:
   time ncks -O -d time,0,,12 ~/ET_2000-01_2001-12.nc ~/foo.nc
   Demonstration with NCL:
   time ncl < ~/nco/data/ncl.ncl   
   20140718: Problem reported by Parker Norton
   20140826: Verified problem still exists
   20140930: Finish NCO workaround for problem
   Cause: Slow algorithm in nc_var_gets()?
   Workaround #1: Use NCO 4.4.6 or later (avoids nc_var_gets())
   Workaround #2: Convert file to netCDF3 first, then use stride

B. NOT YET FIXED (netCDF4 library bug)
   Simultaneously renaming multiple dimensions in netCDF4 file can corrupt output

   Demonstration:
   ncrename -O -d lev,z -d lat,y -d lon,x ~/nco/data/in_grp.nc ~/foo.nc # Completes but file is unreadable
   ncks -v one ~/foo.nc

   20150922: Confirmed problem reported by Isabelle Dast, reported to Unidata
   20150924: Unidata confirmed problem
   20160212: Verified problem still exists in netCDF library
   20160512: Ditto
   20161028: Verified problem still exists with netCDF 4.4.1
   20170323: Verified problem still exists with netCDF 4.4.2-development

   Bug tracking: https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/jira/browse/fxm
   More details: http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#ncrename_crd

C. NOT YET FIXED (netCDF4 library bug)
   Renaming a non-coordinate variable to a coordinate variable fails in netCDF4

   Demonstration:
   ncrename -O -v non_coord,coord ~/nco/data/in_grp.nc ~/foo.nc # Fails (HDF error)

   20170323: Confirmed problem reported by Paolo Oliveri, reported to Unidata

   Bug tracking: https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/jira/browse/fxm
   More details: http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#ncrename_crd

D. FIXED in netCDF Development branch as of 20161116 and in maintenance release 4.4.1.1
   nc-config/nf-config produce erroneous switches that cause NCO builds to fail
   This problem affects netCDF 4.4.1 on all operating systems.
   Some pre-compiled netCDF packages may have patched the problem.
   Hence it does not affect my MacPorts install of netCDF 4.4.1.

   Demonstration:
   % nc-config --cflags # Produces extraneous text that confuses make
   Using nf-config: /usr/local/bin/nf-config
   -I/usr/local/include -I/usr/local/include -I/usr/include/hdf

   If your nc-config output contains the "Using ..." line, you are
   affected by this issue. 

   20161029: Reported problem to Unidata
   20161101: Unidata confirmed reproducibility, attributed to netCDF 4.4.1 changes
   20161116: Unidata patch is in tree for netCDF 4.4.2 release
   20161123: Fixed in maintenance release netCDF 4.4.1.1

E. NOT YET FIXED (would require DAP protocol change?)
   Unable to retrieve contents of variables including period '.' in name
   Periods are legal characters in netCDF variable names.
   Metadata are returned successfully, data are not.
   DAP non-transparency: Works locally, fails through DAP server.

   Demonstration:
   ncks -O -C -D 3 -v var_nm.dot -p http://thredds-test.ucar.edu/thredds/dodsC/testdods in.nc # Fails to find variable

   20130724: Verified problem still exists. 
   Stopped testing because inclusion of var_nm.dot broke all test scripts.
   NB: Hard to fix since DAP interprets '.' as structure delimiter in HTTP query string.

   Bug tracking: https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/jira/browse/NCF-47

F. NOT YET FIXED (would require DAP protocol change)
   Correctly read scalar characters over DAP.
   DAP non-transparency: Works locally, fails through DAP server.
   Problem, IMHO, is with DAP definition/protocol

   Demonstration:
   ncks -O -D 1 -H -C -m --md5_dgs -v md5_a -p http://thredds-test.ucar.edu/thredds/dodsC/testdods in.nc

   20120801: Verified problem still exists
   Bug report not filed
   Cause: DAP translates scalar characters into 64-element (this
   dimension is user-configurable, but still...), NUL-terminated
   strings so MD5 agreement fails 

"Sticky" reminders:

A. Reminder that NCO works on most HDF4 and HDF5 datasets, e.g., 
   HDF4: AMSR MERRA MODIS ...
   HDF5: GLAS ICESat Mabel SBUV ...
   HDF-EOS5: AURA HIRDLS OMI ...
