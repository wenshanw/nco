The netCDF Operators NCO version 4.6.2 are ready. 

http://nco.sf.net (Homepage, Mailing lists)
http://github.com/nco (Source Code, Releases, Developers)

What's new?

4.6.2 is mainly a stability release to polish existing features and to
add minor new ones.

Work on NCO 4.6.3 has commenced and will better support regridding
variables whose horizontal dimensions are not most-rapidly-varying.  

Enjoy,
Charlie

NEW FEATURES (full details always in ChangeLog):

A.

A. ncclimo will now ...

BUG FIXES:

A. ncclimo and ncremap could fail if ${BASH_SOURCE[0]} is unavailable.
   This can be the case, e.g., with the dash shell. This portability
   issue has been resolved.

KNOWN PROBLEMS DUE TO NCO:

   This section of ANNOUNCE reports and reminds users of the
   existence and severity of known, not yet fixed, problems. 
   These problems occur with NCO 4.6.2 built/tested under
   MacOS with netCDF 4.3.3.1 on HDF5 1.8.16 and with
   Linux with netCDF 4.4.1-development (20160212) on HDF5 1.8.13.

A. NOT YET FIXED (NCO problem)
   Correctly read arrays of NC_STRING with embedded delimiters in ncatted arguments

   Demonstration:
   ncatted -D 5 -O -a new_string_att,att_var,c,sng,"list","of","str,ings" ~/nco/data/in_4.nc ~/foo.nc
   ncks -m -C -v att_var ~/foo.nc

   20130724: Verified problem still exists
   TODO nco1102
   Cause: NCO parsing of ncatted arguments is not sophisticated
   enough to handle arrays of NC_STRINGS with embedded delimiters.

B. NOT YET FIXED (NCO problem?)
   ncra/ncrcat (not ncks) hyperslabbing can fail on variables with multiple record dimensions

   Demonstration:
   ncrcat -O -d time,0 ~/nco/data/mrd.nc ~/foo.nc

   20140826: Verified problem still exists
   20140619: Problem reported by rmla
   Cause: Unsure. Maybe ncra.c loop structure not amenable to MRD?
   Workaround: Convert to fixed dimensions then hyperslab

KNOWN PROBLEMS DUE TO BASE LIBRARIES/PROTOCOLS:

A. NOT YET FIXED (netCDF4 or HDF5 problem?)
   Specifying strided hyperslab on large netCDF4 datasets leads
   to slowdown or failure with recent netCDF versions.

   Demonstration with NCO <= 4.4.5:
   time ncks -O -d time,0,,12 ~/ET_2000-01_2001-12.nc ~/foo.nc
   Demonstration with NCL:
   time ncl < ~/nco/data/ncl.ncl   
   20140718: Problem reported by Parker Norton
   20140826: Verified problem still exists
   20140930: Finish NCO workaround for problem
   Cause: Slow algorithm in nc_var_gets()?
   Workaround #1: Use NCO 4.4.6 or later (avoids nc_var_gets())
   Workaround #2: Convert file to netCDF3 first, then use stride

B. NOT YET FIXED (netCDF4 library bug)
   Simultaneously renaming multiple dimensions in netCDF4 file can corrupt output

   Demonstration:
   ncrename -O -d lev,z -d lat,y -d lon,x ~/nco/data/in_grp.nc ~/foo.nc # Completes but file is unreadable
   ncks -v one ~/foo.nc

   20150922: Confirmed problem reported by Isabelle Dast, reported to Unidata
   20150924: Unidata confirmed problem
   20160212: Verified problem still exists in netCDF library
   20160512: Ditto

   Bug tracking: https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/jira/browse/fxm
   More details: http://nco.sf.net/nco.html#ncrename_crd

C. NOT YET FIXED (would require DAP protocol change?)
   Unable to retrieve contents of variables including period '.' in name
   Periods are legal characters in netCDF variable names.
   Metadata are returned successfully, data are not.
   DAP non-transparency: Works locally, fails through DAP server.

   Demonstration:
   ncks -O -C -D 3 -v var_nm.dot -p http://thredds-test.ucar.edu/thredds/dodsC/testdods in.nc # Fails to find variable

   20130724: Verified problem still exists. 
   Stopped testing because inclusion of var_nm.dot broke all test scripts.
   NB: Hard to fix since DAP interprets '.' as structure delimiter in HTTP query string.

   Bug tracking: https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/jira/browse/NCF-47

D. NOT YET FIXED (would require DAP protocol change)
   Correctly read scalar characters over DAP.
   DAP non-transparency: Works locally, fails through DAP server.
   Problem, IMHO, is with DAP definition/protocol

   Demonstration:
   ncks -O -D 1 -H -C -m --md5_dgs -v md5_a -p http://thredds-test.ucar.edu/thredds/dodsC/testdods in.nc

   20120801: Verified problem still exists
   Bug report not filed
   Cause: DAP translates scalar characters into 64-element (this
   dimension is user-configurable, but still...), NUL-terminated
   strings so MD5 agreement fails 

"Sticky" reminders:

A. Reminder that NCO works on most HDF4 and HDF5 datasets, e.g., 
   HDF4: AMSR MERRA MODIS ...
   HDF5: GLAS ICESat Mabel SBUV ...
   HDF-EOS5: AURA HIRDLS OMI ...
