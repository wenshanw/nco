.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B ncpdq
packs or re-shapes variables in 
.I input-file
and stores them in 
.I output-file.
Which variables to pack/unpack are determined by the packing policy 
encoded in the 
.IR pck_plc 
argument to the 
.BR \-P
switch.
Valid 
.IR pck_plc 
options are
.IR all_new, 
.IR all_xst, 
.IR xst_new, 
and
.IR upk.
The numeric type of variable to pack or re-pack a variable to is
determined by the packing map encoded in the 
.IR pck_map
argument to the 
.BR \-M
switch.
Valid 
.IR pck_map
options are
.IR flt_byt,
.IR flt_sht,
.IR hgh_byt,
.IR hgh_sht,
and
.IR nxt_lsr.

.B ncpdq 
re-shapes variables in 
.I input-file
by re-ordering and/or reversing dimensions specified in the dimension list.
The dimension list is a comma separated list of dimension names,
optionally prefixed by negative signs, that follow the 
.BR \-a
switch. 
To re-order variables by a subset of their dimensions, specify
these dimensions in a comma-separated list following
.BR \-a ,
e.g.,
.BR "\-a lon,lat".
To reverse a dimension, prefix its name with a negative sign in the
dimension list, e.g., 
.BR "\-a \-lat". 
Re\-ordering and reversal may be performed simultaneously, e.g.,
.BR "\-a lon,\-lat,time,\-lev". 

Users may specify any permutation of dimensions, including
permutations which change the record dimension identity.
The record dimension is re-ordered like any other dimension.
The record dimension is always the most slowly varying dimension in a
record variable.
The specified re-ordering will fail if it requires creating more than
one record dimension amongst all the output variables.
