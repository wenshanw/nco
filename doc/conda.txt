Travis-CI, which builds our OS X packages, is having trouble. See
https://www.traviscistatus.com/incidents/h6gwvyq9zky0 

Follow the build check at
https://travis-ci.org/conda-forge/nco-feedstock/builds/277263541

> The build-status indicator for both is green on the nco-feedstock
  homepage. Is that a false-negative for OSX? 

Not really, it is probably reflecting the last build.

Build logs are in the Travis CI logs at
https://travis-ci.org/conda-forge/nco-feedstock

conda-forge uses a CentOS 6 docker image to build Linux using
CircleCI. We only use Travis-CI for OS X, so we are not affected.
But thanks for letting us know! 

In conda-forge we do build OS X pkgs with clang by default but not
with OpenMP though, we should look into that.
